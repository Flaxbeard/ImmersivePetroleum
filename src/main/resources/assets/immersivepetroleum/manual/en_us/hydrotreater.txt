Smell of Fireworks
<&hydrotreater0>The Sulfur Recovery Unit (SRU) is a multiblock machine that seperates Sulfur from Sulfurized Diesel by using Hydrogen and Oxygen gained from the Electrolysis of Water.

It uses <config;i;hydrotreater_operationcost> Flux per operation<np>
It is built as shown and formed by using the Engineering's Hammer on the Heavy Engineering Block in the Center

Applying a redstone signal to the control panel will halt the machine's process, this behavior can be inverted by use of the Screwdriver.<np>

Sulfurized Diesel is pumped into the port at the front.
Water is pumped into the port at the top.
Sulfur is dumped out the left side.
Diesel is pumped out of the top port on the left side.
