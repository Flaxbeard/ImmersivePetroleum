Pumpjack
Pump, pump it up
<&pumpjack0>The Pumpjack is a multiblock that extracts Crude Oil from deposits situated underneath bedrock. The structure is formed by using the Engineering's Hammer on the Heavy Engineering Block on the second layer.<np>
The Pumpjack Tower uses <config;i;pumpjack_consumption> Flux/t to pump Crude Oil at a rate of <config;i;pumpjack_speed> mB/t. The produced oil is automatically ejected through the two side ports with orange dots.

The average Oil deposit will take <config;i;pumpjack_days> days to deplete, though adding more Pumpjacks can speed the process.

Applying a redstone signal to the control panel will halt the machine's process, this behavior can be inverted by use of the Screwdriver.
