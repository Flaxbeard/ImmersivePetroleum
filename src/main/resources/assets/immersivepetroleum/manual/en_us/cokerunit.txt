Coker
Very sticky stuff
<&cokerunit0>The Coker is a §overy large§r multiblock structure that further processes Bitumen into Petroleum Coke (Petcoke) and Diesel as a byproduct. It does this by heating the Bitumen up to its thermal cracking temperature. This cracks the heavy, long chain hydrocarbon molecules into Petroleum Coke and Diesel.

It is built as shown and formed by using the Engineering's Hammer on the Concrete Block in the Center, on the side with the Redstone Engineering Block.<np>
Applying a redstone signal to the control panel will halt the machine's process, this behavior can be inverted by use of the Screwdriver.

Water is input at the back, the port is marked with a blue dot and Bitumen can be inserted through the hatch in the middle.
Petcoke is dropped below the chamber chutes.<np>
The coker uses <config;i;coker_operationcost> Flux/t and 125mB Water per chamber while converting Bitumen into Petcoke.

A chamber does not need to be filled up all the way for the coker to start the process, and more can be added during the first phase.
If a chamber is filled up all the way it will try to fill the secondary chamber instead.
