Distillation Tower
Environmentally unfriendly
<&distillationtower0>The Distillation Tower is a large multiblock structure that separates crude oil into a number of byproducts.<np>
It is built as shown and formed by using the Engineering's Hammer on the Redstone Engineering Block.

Applying a redstone signal to the control panel will halt the machine's process, this behavior can be inverted by use of the Screwdriver.

Crude Oil can be input into the Distillation Tower at the back hatch marked with a blue dot, where it will be heated until it separates into a number of layers. This produces a variety of fluids and has a chance to produce Bitumen as a byproduct.

The Distillation Tower uses <config;i;distillationtower_operationcost> Flux per operation, converting up to 75 mB of Crude Oil to Diesel, Lubricant, Gasoline, and Bitumen per tick. The produced fluid mix is output from the side hatch marked with an orange dot; the Bitumen through the front hatch.<np>

Diesel can be used for <link;diesel_generator;§o§npower §o§nproduction§r>, Lubricant for <link;immersivepetroleum:lubricant;§o§noiling §o§nmachines§r>, and Gasoline for <link;immersivepetroleum:portablegenerator;§o§npowering §o§nengines§r> <link;immersivepetroleum:speedboat;§o§nvehicles§r>, or <link;immersivepetroleum:napalm;§o§nNapalm§r>.
Bitumen is used to make <link;immersivepetroleum:asphalt;§o§nAsphalt§r> and can be processed further to get Petroleum Coke in the <link;immersivepetroleum:cokerunit;§o§nCoker§r>.<np>
